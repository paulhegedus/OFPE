# Introduction
This tutorial covers the data import process. This step requires an OFPE formatted database as created on this  [page](https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/db_creation.html) or as done in Vignette 1 of this package. Please refer to the [OFPE Technical Website](https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/index.html) for more information. This tutorial covers the import of on-farm collected data to the database in section 1 and the import of data from Google Earth Engine in section 2.


#### On-Farm Data
The stream of data available from agricultural fields include data collected from farm machinery during normal farm operations such as seeding, spraying, and harvesting. The OFPE project focuses on winter wheat yield and protein as response variables and nitrogen fertilizer or seed rates as explanatory variables, depending on whether the field is farmed conventionally or organically, respectively. These data are collected from the farm machinery as ESRI Shapefiles, barring CropScan protein data that is gathered as a comma-separated values file. These data can be batch uploaded to the database through a script that automatically identifies and organizes each upload.

This vignette and this data import process simply imports each piece of data collected on farms. The import process consists of identifying where the data for upload should be organized within the database. If the data for upload matches the boundary of an experimental field uploaded into the 'all_farms' schema (see Vignette 1). If so, the field is identified, otherwise the data is spatially queried for an intersection with a farm in order to identify the farmer that owns the field. This is used to determine into which farmer's schema to organize the data. Finally, the data is explored for the identification of the year the data was collected. While not required for organizing and importing the data, without identifying the year, the data may not be available for analysis when the user selects the year for analysis.

After the schema that the data should be imported to is identified, the data is queried to determine what type of data it is. Within each schema, tables are divided by data type, with tables for yield, protein, and as-applied inputs. Additionally, the geometry type of each file is determined in order to separate data present as polygons or points. This is only the case for as-applied data that either is collected as polygons or points. 

Finally, the data either creates a new table or is appended to an existing table in the appropriate database schema. After each import session spatial indices on each table are generated, if not previously present, or updated. 

Note that the OFPE formatted database can also handle the upload of [SSURGO soil data](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/survey/?cid=nrcs142p2_053627) that can be used as a covariate. This data can be gathered from the SSURGO database. **NOTE:** when uploading this data, MAKE SURE to have "ssurgo" somewhere in the name of the file.

Also of note is that when import seeding rate data, this **NEEDS** to have either "seed" or "_SR_" in the filename. This is because the seeding rate and as-applied nitrogen rate data are not easily distinguishable from each other.

The process for importing data to the database is outlined and a more detailed description the activity diagram on [this page](https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/dat_import.html), where a component diagram can also be found. This vignette outlines step 2 of the OFPE data cycle, executed using the R package. This is represented by step 2 in the blue ring of the figure below. There is an associated page on the OFPE web application (green ring) that utilizes these R classes and functions to achieve the same effect in a user friendly environment.

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='**Figure 1.** Key is found in the top right corner of the schematic. The green ring represents the R-Shiny OFPE web spplication which is driven by the OFPE R-Package (blue ring). These both require connection to a PostgreSQL spatial database with PostGIS enabled. The yellow boxes represent different pages of the OFPE web application and vignettes in the R-package. Black boxes represent user inputs and orange clouds represent cloud based tools.', echo = FALSE}

#### Google Earth Engine Data
Remote sensing data is collected from Google Earth Engine and includes data temporally variable data such as weather and static data such as topography. The user is responsible for running the Google Earth Engine Javascript code to download data for each year required. See this [tutorial](https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/gee_setup.html) for adding farm boundaries to GEE as asset and this [tutorial](https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/run_gee.html) for editing and using Javascript code. This data is downloaded to Google Drive, where the data can be batch uploaded to the database. See this [tutorial](https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/gd_setup.html) for setting up Google Drive to receive your data from Google Earth Engine.

The user can use the farm boundary shapefiles in the OFPE data package as assets in Google Earth Engine. This way the user will be able to follow along with the rest of the vignettes of this package. Simply write "OFPEDATA::FarmerB_FarmName_bbox", "OFPEDATA::FarmerC_FarmName_bbox", and "OFPEDATA::FarmerI_FarmName_bbox" in a fresh r script and save the shapefiles with the 'sf::st_write()' function. Then the user can upload as a GEE asset as shown in this [tutorial](https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/gee_setup.html).

This [tutorial](https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/run_gee.html) outlines how to gather data from Google Earth Engine. This step needs to be completed before executing section 2 of this vignette. This vignette gathers all variables from all farms from 2015 to 2020, however only 'FarmerB' is used for examples.

The process for importing Google Earth Engine data to the database and a more detailed description is outlined in the activity diagram on [this page](https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/dat_import.html), where a component diagram can also be found. 

Note that parameters like elevation, slope, aspect, TPI, soil great groups, soil texture, bulk density, clay content, sand content, pH, water content, and organic carbon content are collected in GEE for all years, however when aggregated only 2015 is searched for. So, when downloading data from GEE make sure to import these data for 2015.

Again, it is assumed that the user has completed Vignette 1 and understands the database management methods described at this [site](https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/dat_import.html). A database is required to store your data.

# Workflow
The sections below describe the process of importing data collected on-farms to the OFPE formatted database. The initial section loads the required packages and connects to the database. The activity workflow for importing data and a more detailed description is described on [this page](https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/data_import.html), where a component diagram can also be found. The vignette examples with "FarmerB" use only that farmer's data and Google Earth Engine data for the farm boundary of "FarmerB" from 2015 - 2020. This will take about 5GB on your machine.

## 1.0 Set-Up
The below contains the packages used in the vignette and a demonstration of connecting to your database created in this [tutorial](https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/postgres_setup.html). This vignette uses example data located in the [OFPEDATA](https://github.com/paulhegedus/OFPEDATA.git) R-package. This vignette downloads data from the OFPE package in order to demonstrate a realistic data workflow. 

### 1.1 Load Packages

```{r setup, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#devtools::install_github("paulhegedus/OFPE")
#devtools::install_github("paulhegedus/OFPEDATA")
library(OFPE)
library(OFPEDATA)
```

### 1.2 Connect to Database

First, a connection is formed to the database created in this [tutorial](https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/postgres_setup.html). This vignette, and the rest of the vignettes are working with an example database named 'OFPE' (as named in the tutorial above and exemplified in Vignette 1). This package utilizes an R6 class for containing the database connection information and the connection itself. This class defaults to a PostgreSQL database.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dbCon <- DBCon$new(
  user = "postgres",
  password = "<your_password>",
  dbname = "<your_db_name>", 
  host = "localhost",
  port = "5432"
)
OFPE::removeTempTables(dbCon$db)
```

### (Optional) Prepare Example Data
This section is for creating a folder that contains the experimental field data FOR FARMER B. Extract FarmerB's data from the OFPEDATA package and put in a folder in you "~" directory called "INIT_UPLOADS" to follow along after this section. **NOTE:** when using your own data, this section is irrelevant, but you still might want to check out that tutorial. This vignette only uses FarmerB, as with Vignette1. Modify the code below to include data from FarmerC or FarmerI from the OFPEDATA package, but you may need to modify the code below. Again, this section is not used in the workflow, it is simply to get you setup for following along with the vignette.

First, get the names of the data in the OFPEDATA package that has example data for these vignettes. Isolate the names of data corresponding to field data which does not have "_bbox" suffix. Extract from OFPEDATA.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dat <- data(package = "OFPEDATA")
dat_names <- dat$results[, "Item"] %>%
  subset(!grepl("_bbox", dat$results[, "Item"]))
dat_list <- as.list(dat_names) %>%
  `names<-`(dat_names) %>% 
  lapply(function (x) eval(parse(text = x)))
rm(dat, dat_names) 
```

Second, save boundaries to a temporary folder. Again, in your real world situation you do not need to do this. **NOTE:** This example will create a temporary folder called 'INIT_UPLOADS' in your home directory and WILL delete any folder called 'INIT_UPLOADS' in your home directory. Also note that a special case is coded in the 'toTempFolder' function for FarmerB's 2019 protein data.

```{r, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}
temp_path <- "~/INIT_UPLOADS/"
ifelse(dir.exists(temp_path), 
       {do.call(file.remove, list(list.files(temp_path, full.names = TRUE)));
         file.remove(temp_path);
         dir.create(temp_path)},
       dir.create(temp_path)) %>% 
  invisible()
toTempFolder <- function (x, y, farmer) {
  if (grepl(farmer, y)) {
    if (!grepl("pro", y)) {
      sf::st_write(x, paste0(temp_path, y, ".shp"), quiet = TRUE)
    } else {
      if (grepl("2019", y)) {
        data.table::fwrite(x, paste0(temp_path, y, ".csv"))
      } else {
        sf::st_write(x, paste0(temp_path, y, ".shp"), quiet = TRUE)
      }
    }
  }
}
# only using farmer B as an example, repeat for other farmers if desired
invisible(mapply(toTempFolder,
       dat_list, 
       names(dat_list),
       MoreArgs = list(farmer = "FarmerB")))
rm(dat_list, temp_path)
```


## 2.0 Import On-Farm Data
The steps required for importing the data consist of initializing the import data R6 class with the path to the folder in which the data to be uploaded is saved. It is efficient to put all the data you want to import into one folder and path to that. That way you can instantiate the class, run it, and walk away for awhile while it loads. The on-farm import class has a method for initializing and a method for running. After the completion of the execution method, a data frame with the status of each attempted file is generated.

### 2.1 Initialize ImportOF
The ImportOF class is initialized with the path to the location of the data that the user wants to upload and a database object. This class can be initialized and executed as many times as needed. Data that is already present in the database and reuploaded to the database will be replaced.

All of the data available in the example data from the [OFPEDATA](https://github.com/paulhegedus/OFPEDATA.git) package are used as an example here. The steps for uploading data are always the same.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dat_path <- "<your/folder/path>"
importOF <- ImportOF$new(dbCon, dat_path)
```

### 2.2 Import On-Farm Data
The execution method of the ImportOF class simply requires the file names to the data that is to be uploaded into the database. After the method has completed execution, the 'status' object in the ImportOF R6 class will indicate which files uploaded successfully and which did not.

**NOTE:** This process may take some significant time depending on how much data you have in your specified upload folder. Go grab a coffee or take a break and work on something else.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
importOF$executeUpload()
```


### 2.3 Check Status
After the 'uploadData' method of the 'ImportOF' class has been executed, the import status of your data can be found in the 'status' object, a data.frame indicating the completion/fail of each file name.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
importOF$status
```


## 3.0 Import Google Earth Engine Data
The steps required for importing data from Google Earth Engine are outlined below. Google Earth Engine data is gathered as discussed in these tutorials, [Google Earth Engine Set-Up](https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/gee_setup.html) and  [Run Google Earth Engine](https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/run_gee.html). Data is downloaded from GEE to Google Drive, where it is accessed by the R6 class below.

This class utilizes the same database connection used for importing data on-farms.

Before using the ImportGEE class, the Google Drive account where the user data is stored needs to be authorized. Simply insert your email address in the line below.

###### 3.0.1 - Setup Google Earth Engine : https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/gee_setup.html
###### 3.0.2 - Setup Google Drive : https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/gd_setup.html
###### 3.0.3 - Run Google Earth Engine : https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/run_gee.html
###### 3.0.4 - Authorize Google Drive
```{r, eval = FALSE}
googledrive::drive_auth("<your_email@address>")
```

### 3.1 Initialize ImportGEE
The ImportGEE class is initialized with the path to the location of the Google Drive folder where the data is connected, and a database connection. This class can be initialized and executed as many times as needed. Data that is already present in the database and re-uploaded to the database will be replaced if desired by setting the option of OVERWRITE to TRUE. 

If following along with the FarmerB example for these vignettes, you will likely only want to import Farmer B's GEE data, so put in a specific folder in your Google Drive and set the path to that (e.g. make a folder called 'GEE_Surfaces_FarmerB').

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dat_path <- "<your_google_drive_foldername>"
importGEE <- ImportGEE$new(dbCon, dat_path, FALSE)
```

### 3.2 Import Google Earth Engine Data
The execution method of the ImportGEE class simply requires the name of the Google Drive folder with data to be uploaded into the database. As data is uploaded, messages will appear on the status of the import.

**NOTE:** This process takes some significant time depending on how much data you have in your specified Google Drive folder. Go grab a coffee or take a break and work on something else.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
importGEE$executeUpload()
```


# Conclusion
This vignette provided a demonstration of how to import your on-farm data and data gathered from Google Earth Engine. This also covers how to import SSURGO data to the database. **IMPORTANT:** when uploading seeding rate data include "seed" or "_SR_" in the filename to distinguish from as-applied nitrogen fertilizer data and when uploading SSURGO data include "SSURGO" or "ssurgo" to the filename.

A diagram demonstrating the implementation and existence of modules related to the data import step can be seen [here](https://paulhegedus.github.io/OFPE-Website/dat_import.html), diagramming the relationship of the classes used in this step. 

Whenever a database connection is open it needs to be closed.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
dbCon$disconnect()
```
