## Overview
The On-Farm Precision Experiments (OFPE) package is developed by the Agroecology Lab at Montana State University and provides the tools for researchers and producers to manage and analyze data collected from individual fields to make field specific recommendations of agricultural inputs. This project requires the experimental application of input rates to develop crop response functions for predicting outcomes of various management scenarios.

This package contains tools for creating a database to store field specific information, importing data collected on-farms or from remotely-sensed sources to the database, enriching yield and protein datasets with covariate data, analysis and simulation of winter wheat yield and grain able input rates (nitrogen fertilizer or seed), and generation of input prescriptions based on field specific predictions based on field specific data.

## Installation

You can install the released version of OFPE from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("paulhegedus/OFPE")
```

## Intended Use/Disclaimer
The OFPE packages is intended to make the management, analysis, and development of agricultural input management prescriptions easy. This package is intended to be used with dryland winter wheat harvest and application data collected in Montana, USA or Manitoba, Canada. The codebase constitutes the backend of the associate OFPE Shiny web application <*URL*>. This package was developed using conventional and organic winter wheat data and intended to inform site-specific management decisions of nitrogen fertilizer or seed rates. 

The OFPE package is not intended for use outside of Montana and Manitoba or for crops other than dryland winter wheat. We are not liable for any damages, actions, or outcomes of any decision made while using this this package or any associated intellectual property.

## Requirements
The workflows outlined and supported by functions in this package operate with the assumption that the user has access to or has created a PostgreSQL database. Associated tools such as PostGIS are required for data management. \newline
Instructions for downloading PostgreSQL and setting up a postgres server can be found here: <*URL*>

This package includes functions for interfacing with Google Eart Engine and 

While not required, it is assumed that the user is using grain protein percent  


The functions and workflows operate on the premise that the user has created or access to a PostgreSQL database

## Example
You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
