Title: On-Farm Precision Experiments (OFPE) Data Management and Analysis Tools
Description: The MT OFPE project lays out a concenptual framework for a data 
    intensive field management approach to dryland winter wheat production in
    MT using experimentally applied input rates such as nitrogen fertilizer and 
    seed. This package contains tools for managing a database to store field
    specific information, importing data collected on-farms or from remotely-
    sensed sources to the database, enriching yield and protein datasets with 
    covariate data, analysis and simulation of winter wheat yield and grain
    protein response to variable input rates (nitrogen fertilizer or seed), 
    and generation of input prescriptions based on field specific predictions
    based on field specific data.
