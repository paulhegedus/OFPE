#' Function for calculating the net-return for different
#' management scenarios under the selected economic conditions
#' for each location in the data frame. For each point the
#' net-retrun is calculated with the base price, and the
#' opposite system type's base price. If the rate is equal
#' to the farmer selected or the minimum experimental rates, the
#' net-return for those economic conditions are calculated.
#'
#' @param df A matrix with the experimental rate and predicted
#' responses for each data point in the field.
#' @param Bp The base price corresponding to the price for the system
#' type selected by the user (i.e. conventional or organic).

#' @param B1pd The coefficient for protein in the protein premium/dockage
#' equation.
#' @param B2pd The coefficient for protein squared for the protein
#' premium/dockage equation.
#' @param CEXP The cost of the experimental input.
#' @param BpOpp The base price corresponding to the price for the opposite
#' system type selected by the user (i.e. conventional or organic).
#' @param FC The fixed costs associated with production per acre, not including
#' the experimental input.
#' @param fs The farmer selected rate or the rate of the experimental
#' input that the farmer would have applied uniformly to the field.
#' @param ssAC The cost of site-specific technology or variable rate
#' application.
#' @param predInd Indicator for whether protein is included or not

#' Function for identifying the optimum full-field experimental rate based on
#' profit maximization. This function selects the optimum rate as
#' the rate where the difference in full-field net-return between
#' experimental rates (first derivitave of the net-return vs. experimental rate
#' function) does not exceed the cost of applying one more unit of
#' the experimental rate across the entire field.
#'
#' This function calculates the optimum rate from the sum of the
#' net-return for a uniform rate applied across the field to
#' identify the full-field optimum rate.
#'
#' See the documentation in OFPE::derivNRoptCpp for a site-specific
#' example of how the optimum is identified compared to when the
#' optimization method is set to 'max'.
#'
#' @param NRff A matrix with rows for each experimental rate and
#' columns for the rate and the full-field net-return calculated
#' under a uniform application of the corresponding rate.
