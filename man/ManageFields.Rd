\title{R6 Class for adding or updating field information in OFPE database.}
\description{
R6 class that takes a vector of field names and a path
to the location of field boundary shapefiles. Uploads boundaries to the
database. Adds a unique ID field for each field that is used for
internal relationships and identifies the associated farmer with the fields.
If a field is already present in the database,
it will be replaced with the same field ID. This follows the ManageDB
interface and includes a setup and execute method that is called from
the ManageDB class.

\if{latex}{\out{\hypertarget{method-new}{}}}
\subsection{Method \code{new()}}{
Create an ManageFields object. The database connection and a vector of
field names and farmer names are used to upload field information
to the database with the appropriate owner information. The field_path
argument indicates the file path in which to follow for the field boundary
shapefiles that are to be uploaded to the database. Instantiates the class
for running the setup and execute methods.
\subsection{Usage}{
\if{html}{\out{<div class="r">}}\preformatted{ManageFields$new(dbCon, field_names, field_farmer_names, field_path)}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

\describe{
\item{\code{dbCon}}{Database connection object connected to an OFPE formatted
database, see DBCon class.}

\item{\code{field_names}}{Vector of field names to add or update in the database.}

owner of the field names supplied.}

\item{\code{field_path}}{File path to the location of field boundary shapefiles.}

\if{latex}{\out{\hypertarget{method-setup}{}}}
\subsection{Method \code{setup()}}{
Prepares the field data prior to uploading to the database. Imports
shapefiles from the field path and puts them into a list with the
corresponding farmer to be uploaded to the database.

\item{\code{None}}{No arguments needed because they are provided during class
initialization.}

\if{latex}{\out{\hypertarget{method-execute}{}}}
\subsection{Method \code{execute()}}{
Executes the upload of prepared field information to the database in the
'all_farms' schema and the 'fields' table. If a field boundary is already
present with the same field name and farmer that owns it, the entry in the
database is replaced.
